skypy - Python api for Sky tv (UK)

Currently supports retrieving EPG data and remote record.

Usage
------
from skypy.epg import epg
from skypy.record import record

e = epg()
print e.programmes(channelFilter=['2002',])
record(1002, 1464)

- Supports a number of api to retrieve channels and programmes.
- Supports remote record. (Probably the only api as of now)

TODO
----
- Conflict resolution during recording since sky themselves do not support this.
